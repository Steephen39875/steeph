Here is a detailed documentation for the code:

## Overview

This is a simple web page that allows the user to upload an image, extracts the dominant colors from that image, and displays those colors on the page. 

## HTML Structure

- The HTML has a simple layout with a heading, file input, image preview, and color display containers. 
- Styling is applied with CSS to center elements, style the color displays, etc.

## Functionality 

- When the file input changes, the image is loaded and displayed in the preview. 
- The ColorThief library is used to extract the top 3 dominant colors from the image.
- Those colors are displayed in the color containers by setting their background colors.

## Step by Step Explanation

1. Add event listener to the file input to respond to changes
2. When a file is selected:
   - Create a FileReader to read the file 
   - In the onloadend callback:
     - Set the preview image source to the FileReader result
     - Call extractColors() passing the image URL
3. The extractColors() function:
   - Create a new image object
   - Set CORS permissions to allow cross-origin reading
   - Set the image source to the passed in image URL
   - In the onload callback:
     - Create new ColorThief instance
     - Get the top 3 palette colors 
     - Set the background colors of the display elements

This allows an image to be uploaded, analyzed for dominant colors, and those colors extracted and displayed dynamically on the page.
